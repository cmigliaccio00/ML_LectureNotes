\chapter{Computer vision and Convolutional Neural Networks}

\textbf{Computer Vision} is a field of Artificial Intelligence which aims to implement models that performs visual tasks. Some of the tasks in this field are for example: image classification, object detection within an image envoloping it in a box (for example), the so-called \textit{neural style transfer}. All of this tasks, for the nature of the input data involves an enormous number of features which corresponds to a huge number of parameters to learn. How we have said several times, a \textit{classical neural network} (shallow) for example, cannot perform properly and in acceptable time such a task. There are sometimes billion parameters to learn! For this reason \textbf{convolutional architectures}, and then \textbf{convolutional neural networks} are introduced.
